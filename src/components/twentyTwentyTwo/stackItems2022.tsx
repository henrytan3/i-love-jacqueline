        The night we went to Chicken Fight! We ate soooo much chicken that night
        and we even got on the mind eraser! <br />
        You looked so pretty that night and you wore the necklace I got you!{' '}
        <br />
        Thanks for taking me to Chicken Fight! <br />
        How lucky am I to be with you? ‚ù§Ô∏è

        Zoo day!! I didn't get any pictures of us at the zoo but we saw so many
        cute animals like the baby orangutan! <br />
        Afterwards we went to the park to paint, I had so much fun that day! You
        can choose the Bob Ross video next time! <br />
        Every day with you is so amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è
